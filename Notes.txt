1 Intro
* Welcome back, Johnny and Missy our TAs (Time Keeping, Walking around)
* Make sure you do a `git pull` for the new code and recent changes
* Today we will be working with CSV files in Python and JS Objects

2 Python - Cereal Cleaner
* Important to find your editor, and because we need to get used to command line, emacs
* Documentation: RealPython.org, docs.python.org
- CSV - https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
- OS  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os#module-os
* Open directions, and CSV and observe the data type of Fiber
* Run solved to show output... you will have 10 minutes to complete the exercise alone after which we will walk through as a class
* SIDE NOTE: Python is dynamically typed, but is also strongly typed. Meaning I don't have to tell Py what kind of data goes into a variable. However it is, strongly typed? What does that mean?
	* Dynamically typed = data typed at runtime, python figures it out when it's ran
	* Statically typed  = data is typed prior to runtime, such as in Java and C++
	* Strongly typed    = it has strict rules about ints, floats, and strings, etc...
	* Weakly typed      = anything goes, JavaScript is a weakly typed language
* How do we feel? :+1: :-1:
* CODE:
# Open and read csv
with open(cereal_csv, newline="") as csvfile:
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")

    # Read the header row first (skip this part if there is no header)
    csv_header = next(csvfile)
    print(f"Header: {csv_header}")

    # Read through each row of data after the header
    for row in csvreader:

        # Convert row to float and compare to grams of fiber
        if float(row[7]) >= 5:
            print(row)
