1 Intro
* Welcome back, Johnny and Missy our TAs (Time Keeping, Walking around)
* Make sure you do a `git pull` for the new code and recent changes
* Today we will be working with CSV files in Python and JS Objects

2 Python - Cereal Cleaner
* Important to find your editor, and because we need to get used to command line, emacs
* Documentation: RealPython.org, docs.python.org
- CSV - https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html
- OS  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os#module-os
* Open directions, and CSV and observe the data type of Fiber
* Run solved to show output... you will have 10 minutes to complete the exercise alone after which we will walk through as a class
* SIDE NOTE: Python is dynamically typed, but is also strongly typed. Meaning I don't have to tell Py what kind of data goes into a variable. However it is, strongly typed? What does that mean?
	* Dynamically typed = data typed at runtime, python figures it out when it's ran
	* Statically typed  = data is typed prior to runtime, such as in Java and C++
	* Strongly typed    = it has strict rules about ints, floats, and strings, etc...
	* Weakly typed      = anything goes, JavaScript is a weakly typed language
* How do we feel? :+1: :-1:
* CODE:
# Open and read csv
with open(cereal_csv, newline="") as csvfile:
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=",")

    # Read the header row first (skip this part if there is no header)
    csv_header = next(csvfile)
    print(f"Header: {csv_header}")

    # Read through each row of data after the header
    for row in csvreader:

        # Convert row to float and compare to grams of fiber
        if float(row[7]) >= 5:
            print(row)

* Questions? How are we feeling? +1 -1

3 JS - JavaScript Objects
* Many similarities with Python... what are the differences? 
* Open VS Code for this one
* Documentation mdn <search term>, mozilla.org
- Object - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object
* Python dictionary or JS Object
var movie = {
  name: "Star Wars",
  year: 1977,
  profitable: true,
  sequels: [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, "The Last Jedi"]
}
console.log(<print key>)
movie.rating = 10;
delete move.rating;
* Objects**
var people = {
  mom: "wilma flintstone",
  dad: "fred flintstone",
  daughter: "pebbles",
  son: "bambam"
};
Object.keys(novie)
Object.values(movie)
Object.entries(movie)
* How we feeling? +1 -1, Questions

4 - JS - Word Counter
* Building on other sessions... any questions before we begin.
* Open instructions & output, 10 minutes to code this up.
- forEach() - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
* How do we feel after that exercise? +1 -1
CODE:
function wordCount(myString) {
  // Convert string to an array of words
  var stringArray = myString.split(" ");

  // An object to hold word frequency
  var wordFrequency = {};

  // Iterate through the array
  for (var i = 0; i < stringArray.length; i++) {
    var currentWord = stringArray[i];
    // If the word has been seen before...
    if (currentWord in wordFrequency) {
      // Add one to the counter
      wordFrequency[currentWord] += 1;
    }
    else {
      // Set the counter at 1
      wordFrequency[currentWord] = 1;
    }
  }
  console.log(wordFrequency);
  return wordFrequency;
}
* BONUS: How to use forEach and anonymous function?
stringArray.forEach(function(currentWord) {
* BONUS * 2: How to use an arrow function
stringArray.forEach((currentWord) => {
